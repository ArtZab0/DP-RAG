    "question": "**Question:** If Document A discusses the process of photosynthesis in plants, explaining the role of sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide, and Document B provides an example of a tropical rainforest and its reliance on large trees that perform photosynthesis, what specific detail from Document A could be used to explain how the trees in a tropical rainforest contribute to the oxygen production that sustains the biodiversity in that ecosystem?",
    "dp_rag_response": "No documents available.",
    "standard_rag_response": "No documents available.",
    "evaluation": "DP-RAG Scores:\n- Relevance: 1\n- Accuracy: 1\n- Comprehensiveness: 1\n\nStandard RAG Scores:\n- Relevance: 1\n- Accuracy: 1\n- Comprehensiveness: 1\n\nExplanation: Both DP-RAG and Standard RAG systems have failed to provide any meaningful response to the given question. Since both systems responded with \"No documents available,\" they did not address the question at all and did not reference any specific details from Document A that could explain the role of photosynthesis in tropical rainforests.\n\nGiven the lack of useful information, both systems' responses are equally poor across all criteria. The response is not relevant to the question since it provides no information, making both systems score low on relevance, accuracy, and comprehensiveness. Ideally, the system should have provided a relevant detail about the process of photosynthesis from Document A and linked this to the biodiversity of tropical rainforests as described in Document B. Since no such detail was given, neither system performed well, hence the low scores."
