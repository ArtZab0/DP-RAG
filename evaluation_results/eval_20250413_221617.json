    "dp_rag_response": "No documents available.",

    "evaluation": "DP-RAG Scores:\n- Relevance: 7\n- Accuracy: 10\n- Comprehensiveness: 3\n\nStandard RAG Scores:\n- Relevance: 7\n- Accuracy: 10\n- Comprehensiveness: 3\n\nExplanation:\nBoth the DP-RAG and Standard RAG systems provided the same response, \"No documents available.\" This response is relevant to the situation since neither system has access to the documents that were not provided in the original request. Therefore, the question cannot be answered with specific details from documents. The response is accurate because it reflects the reality of the lack of document input. However, the response is not very comprehensive. It fails to elaborate or suggest potential next steps, such as requesting the input again or suggesting an alternative way to provide the information requested.\n\nIn this evaluation context, there is no significant difference between the DP-RAG and Standard RAG response as both systems delivered identically. Both responses could be improved by offering further clarification, guidance, or suggestions for additional information. If the systems were given the option to ask for clarification or prompt the user to provide the necessary documents, that would improve their scores, particularly in comprehensiveness."
