    "question": "1. According to the document on advancements in solar panel technology, what specific technological improvement made in the last decade has significantly increased the efficiency of solar panels?",
    "dp_rag_response": "No documents available.",
    "standard_rag_response": "No documents available.",
    "evaluation": "DP-RAG Scores:\n- Relevance: 1\n- Accuracy: 1\n- Comprehensiveness: 1\n\nStandard RAG Scores:\n- Relevance: 1\n- Accuracy: 1\n- Comprehensiveness: 1\n\nExplanation: Both DP-RAG and Standard RAG provide responses that are completely uninformative and fail to address the specific question about advancements in solar panel technology. Since there is no useful information provided in either of the responses, the scores for all three criteria are at the minimum. The key difference between the two responses is minimal; both systems failed to retrieve or provide any relevant documents that could have answered the question. The responses are identical (\"No documents available.\") in their lack of substance, indicating a systemic failure in retrieving the necessary information from their databases or sources."

    "question": "2. The document discussing the impact of solar energy mentions various countries leading in solar energy adoption. Which country is highlighted for decreasing its global carbon emissions the most due to the widespread use of solar energy, and what percentage reduction is noted?",
    "dp_rag_response": "No documents available.",
    "standard_rag_response": "No documents available.",
    "evaluation": "DP-RAG Scores:\n- Relevance: 2\n- Accuracy: 2\n- Comprehensiveness: 2\n\nStandard RAG Scores:\n- Relevance: 2\n- Accuracy: 2\n- Comprehensiveness: 2\n\nExplanation:\nGiven the response of both RAG systems (\"No documents available\"), neither system was able to retrieve and utilize any relevant information to answer the question. This failure impacts the scores for all three criteria as follows:\n\n- **Relevance**: Neither system could provide a relevant response, since \"No documents available\" does not address the specific question about which country has contributed the most to global carbon emissions reductions through solar energy adoption.\n- **Accuracy**: Both systems' response cannot be evaluated for accuracy since they did not provide any details or data that could be fact-checked.\n- **Comprehensiveness**: No comprehension of the question or detail is provided by either system. Since no information was retrieved or used, the response is completely lacking in all aspects of the question.\n\nIn this case, both systems have the same performance metrics due to identical responses, indicating either a broad failure to gather relevant documents or a potential configuration issue with the document retrieval part of the system. Ideally, an RAG system should be able to find and use relevant documents to answer the question or explicitly acknowledge its limitations more informatively."
