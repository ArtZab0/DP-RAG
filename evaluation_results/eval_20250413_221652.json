The response clearly reflects the absence of the necessary input rather than an attempt to generate a detailed answer without the required information. The scoring reflects a moderate level of evaluation across all criteria since the systems successfully identify the required information (documents/content) is missing, but both are limited in their ability to be more helpful due to the lack of provided input. There are no noticeable differences in performance between the two systems based on the provided scenario."
